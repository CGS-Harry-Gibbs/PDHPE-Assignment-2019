				As a Year 10 student I am really looking forward to driving formally and have always looked forward to it. But, I do understand that there are a lot of risks involved with driving,
				and it’s good to take the time to assess and identify these before taking the actual driving
				test.<br><br>
				As I see it the biggest key to road safety is recognising the dangers and sticking to the rules.
				Speeding is something I would especially like to target. Speed limits are there for a reason,
				and once you are up and over the limit you can easily lose control of the car. As well as speeding can attract extremely bad fines from the traffic
				camera, and at worst the possibility of a major car accident could occur.<br><br>

				<img src="https://gajic.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fatal-car-accident.jpg" style="float: left; height: 200px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; ">


				I know that you can only become a really good driver with experience, but if you at least
				follow the rules you can start out safely. I think the biggest problems for young drivers are
				speeding, distraction, showing off or trying to impress people, taking illegal substances, and
				driving tired or emotional. I also think that mobile phones are a really major cause of
				accidents, as drivers are too desperate to check new messages that come in, and often text
				while they’re driving. I know it is really tempting to look at the phone when you hear a
				notification, but phones are really distracting and a major cause of traffic accidents.<br><br><br>
				<br/><br/>
				Lets take a specific driving skill/technique and compare it to the law. <br><br/> <a style="font-weight: bold; color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Speeding Limits</a> <br><br/>
				Because there are a lot of factors into determining what speed we drive (and maintaining that at a lawful pace), we must first look at some of the factors in which these speed are set:
				<img src="https://www.mynrma.com.au/-/media/motoring-education/mobile-banner-school-zones.jpg?h=360&la=en&w=640&hash=29542338BD1C7992B90264188137DC9D" style="float: right; height: 200px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">

				<ul style="text-align:left;">
					<li>The number and configuration of traffic lanes</li>
					<li>Housing density and type of development</li>
					<li>The amount of on-road parking</li>
					<li>Access to property arrangements</li>
					<li>Traffic signals</li>
					<li>Patterns of crashes that have occurred</li>
					<li>School zones</li>
				</ul>

				<br><br>
				As a new driver (and for any current driver) we must obey and realise these rules are in place for a reason. Another incentive to make sure everyone is lawfully following these rules the government will also fine and punnish people who don't follow these laws. Speeding consequences involve:

				<ul style="text-align:left;">
					<li>Receiving a fine</li>
					<li>Receiving demerit points</li>
					<li>Losing your licence</li>
					<li><a style="font-weight: bold;">Killing</a> or <a style="font-weight: bold;">injuring yourself</a>, loved ones or other road users.</li>
				</ul>
			</p2>

			<p>
				Some other important behaviours which we can generally look at while driving are:
			</p>
			<ul style="text-align:left;">
				<li>To stay off the phone whilst driving</li>
				<li>Always wear a seatbelt and make all passengers do too</li>
				<li>Be serious</li>
				<li>Follow road rules and don’t speed</li>
				<li>Don’t get angry while driving or cause road rage in other drivers</li>
				<li>Never drink or take drugs and drive</li>
				<li>Don’t show off with friends in the car and remember you’ve got their lives in your hands</li>
				<li>Don’t drive when tired</li>
				<li>If something really bad happened in your day take a break before driving</li>
